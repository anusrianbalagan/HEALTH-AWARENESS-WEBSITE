            <h2>Getting Help for Your Mental Health</h2>
            <p>We take a public mental health approach to prevention, finding solutions for individuals, those at risk and for society, in order to improve everyone’s mental wellbeing.

                    <p>The practical things we do
                        Community and peer programmes: we test and evaluate the best approaches to improving mental health in communities and then roll them out as widely as possible.
                        </p>

                <li>
                   
                    <p>Research: we publish studies and reports on what protects mental health and the causes of poor mental health and how to tackle them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  
                    <p>Public engagement: we give advice to millions of people on mental health. We are most well known for running Mental Health Awareness Week across the UK each year.

                    <p>Advocacy: we propose solutions and campaign for change to address the underlying causes of poor mental health.

                    <h3>What we don’t do  
                </h3>
                    <p>We are not an academic think tank or research institute. We generate and apply evidence in real world settings.  
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                   
                    <p>We are not a mental health service provider for when people are unwell.  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    <p>We don't only focus on individual actions and steps - we look at both the personal and societal changes that can improve and protect everyone’s mental health.</p>

                    <h3>Online Resources</h3>
                    <p>There are numerous online resources, articles, and forums that provide information and support for mental health. These resources can help you understand your condition better and connect with a broader community of individuals facing similar challenges.</p>
